# Project Overview

This project is designed to leverage the power of natural language processing (NLP) and external APIs to generate summaries about specific topics. In this case, the focus is on generating a summary of the geographical boundaries of India using a detailed description as input. The project integrates Python and several libraries to accomplish this task.

## Key Components

- **Langchain and Langchain OpenAI**: Utilized for building and executing language models. These libraries are essential for generating prompts and interacting with OpenAI's language models to process the input information.
- **Langfuse**: Handles callbacks, likely for managing responses or interactions with an external service. The project is configured for both EU and US regions, with the US region being actively used.
- **Information Processing**: A large string variable `information` contains a detailed description of India, which serves as input for the summary generation process.
- **Summary Generation**: A template is defined to instruct the language model on how to process the `information` variable to extract details about India's boundaries.
- **Language Model Configuration**: Configures a language model from OpenAI (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) with a specific temperature setting to control the creativity of the model's responses.
- **Execution Flow**: The process involves creating a prompt template, configuring the language model, and invoking the model with the provided information and callback handler to generate the desired summary.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
3. Run the `main.py` script:

## Configuration

The project is currently configured to use the US region for Langfuse. If you need to switch to the EU region, modify the `host` parameter in the `CallbackHandler` configuration within `main.py`.
